#summary Coding guidelines for Dil.

= Coding Rules =
You must adhere to the following rules, if you would like to contribute code to this project:

  * Indent with two spaces. No tabs.
  * 80 characters is pretty much a strict limit (only to be broken if absolutely necessary.)
  * All Ddoc comments start with three slashes, e.g.: `/// Returns xyz.`
  * One space between keyword and left parenthesis, e.g.: `while (something() == 1)`
  * Curly braces are always on a new line. Exception: a control statement with only two inner statements.
  * List internal imports first, then foreign (Tango) imports.
